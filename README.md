# About web_backend

rusEfi backend is facilitating data flow within [https://rusefi.com/](https://rusefi.com/) open source engine management community.

As of 2020, the primary goal of rusEfi web is to flow data from early adopters to developers.

1) for developers: log file upload & sharing
1) for developers & early adopters: tune sharing
1) for early adopters: tune update via web



We have [TunerStudio Plugin](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/TS-Plugin) as one of the frontends.
