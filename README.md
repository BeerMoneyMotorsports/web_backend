# web_backend

rusEfi backend is facilitating data flow within rusEfi open source engine management community.

As of 2020, the primary goal of rusEfi web is to flow data from early adepts to developers.

1) for developers: log file upload & sharing
1) for developers & early adepts: tune sharing
1) for early adepts: tune update via web



There is a desire to have TunerStudio Plugin as on of the frontends.
